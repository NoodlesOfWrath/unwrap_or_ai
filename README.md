## 🏆 INDUSTRY-LEADING INNOVATION

**This is the future of error handling, available TODAY!** Experience the next evolution of Rust development with AI-powered reliability that adapts to your application's unique needs in real-time!

---

## 📦 Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
unwrap_or_ai = "0.1.0"
unwrap_or_ai_proc_macro = "0.1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
schemars = "0.8"
```

```bash
# Experience the revolution!
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unwrap_or_ai
cd unwrap_or_ai
cargo run

# Transform your project today:
cargo add unwrap_or_ai unwrap_or_ai_proc_macro
```

---

## 🎮 Usage

Transform your failing Rust functions into **INTELLIGENT SUCCESS SYSTEMS**:

```rust
use unwrap_or_ai::unwrap_or_ai;
use unwrap_or_ai_proc_macro::unwrap_or_ai_func;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
struct User {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    email: String,
    age: u32,
    department: String,
}

// Legacy approach (OUTDATED):
// let user = fetch_user_from_database(123).unwrap(); // 💥 SYSTEM FAILURE!

// AI-ENHANCED APPROACH:
#[unwrap_or_ai_func]
fn fetch_user_from_database(user_id: u32) -> Result<User, String> {
    Err("Database temporarily unavailable".to_string())
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // INTELLIGENT RECOVERY IN ACTION:
    let user = unwrap_or_ai!(fetch_user_from_database(12345)).await;
    
    // ✨ AI generates contextually perfect User data! ✨
    match user {
        Ok(intelligent_user) => {
            println!("🎯 AI-generated user: {}", intelligent_user.name);
            // Outputs: "🎯 AI-generated user: Michael Johnson"
        }
        Err(_) => unreachable!(), // Never happens with AI recovery! 🚀
    }
}
```

### 🌟 PRODUCTION SUCCESS STORIES

```rust
// E-Commerce Platform - ZERO DOWNTIME
println!("💳 Processing critical payment...");
let payment = unwrap_or_ai!(process_payment(599.99, 12345)).await;
// AI maintains business continuity when payment gateway fails!

println!("🌤️ Weather service integration...");  
let weather = unwrap_or_ai!(get_weather_data("San Francisco")).await;
// AI delivers accurate weather data even during API outages!

println!("⚙️ User experience optimization...");
let prefs = unwrap_or_ai!(get_user_preferences(67890)).await;
// AI creates personalized preferences that enhance user satisfaction!
```
