  <h1> THE FUTURE OF ERROR HANDLING IS HERE</h1>
</div>

## REVOLUTIONIZE YOUR PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

**Tired of manually handling `unwrap()` results? Let AI do the heavy lifting!**

## What is unwrap_or_ai?

**THE REVOLUTIONARY BREAKTHROUGH** that transforms how you think about error handling forever! `unwrap_or_ai` harnesses the **CUTTING-EDGE POWER** of artificial intelligence to create the most advanced error recovery system ever built for Rust:

- 🧠 **DEEP LEARNING ANALYSIS** - Understands your code structure at a molecular level
- ⚡ **INSTANT RECOVERY** - Generates perfect fallback data in microseconds  
- 🎯 **INTELLIGENT PREDICTION** - AI predicts exactly what your application needs
- 🔄 **SEAMLESS INTEGRATION** - Drop-in replacement for traditional error handling
- 📈 **PRODUCTION OPTIMIZED** - Built for enterprise-scale reliability

> **NEXT-GENERATION TECHNOLOGY**  
> This isn't just error handling - it's **INTELLIGENT ERROR EVOLUTION**. Our advanced neural networks have been trained on millions of successful Rust applications to deliver results that exceed human expectations!

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **NEURAL ERROR RECOVERY** | Transforms failures into intelligent, contextual responses |
| **RUST-FIRST ARCHITECTURE** | Native async/await with zero-cost abstractions |
| **ENTERPRISE READY** | Battle-tested AI algorithms for mission-critical applications |
| **PREDICTIVE INTELLIGENCE** | Anticipates user needs with 99.7% accuracy |
| **LIGHTNING DEPLOYMENT** | One macro annotation changes everything |
| **ADAPTIVE LEARNING** | Gets smarter with every function call |

## Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
unwrap_or_ai = "0.1.0"
unwrap_or_ai_proc_macro = "0.1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
schemars = "0.8"
```

```bash
# Experience the revolution!
git clone https://github.com/NoodlesOfWrath/unwrap_or_ai
cd unwrap_or_ai
cargo run

# Transform your project today:
cargo add unwrap_or_ai unwrap_or_ai_proc_macro
```

---

## Usage

Transform your failing Rust functions into **INTELLIGENT SUCCESS SYSTEMS**:

```rust
use unwrap_or_ai::unwrap_or_ai;
use unwrap_or_ai_proc_macro::unwrap_or_ai_func;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
struct User {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    email: String,
    age: u32,
    department: String,
}

// AI-ENHANCED APPROACH:
#[unwrap_or_ai_func]
fn fetch_user_from_database(user_id: u32) -> Result<User, String> {
    Err("Database temporarily unavailable".to_string())
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // INTELLIGENT RECOVERY IN ACTION:
    let user = unwrap_or_ai!(fetch_user_from_database(12345)).await;
    
    match user {
        Ok(intelligent_user) => {
            println!("AI-generated user: {}", intelligent_user.name);
        }
        Err(_) => unreachable!(), // Never happens with AI recovery!
    }
}
```

## TESTIMONIALS FROM SATISFIED USERS

> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
> *"My database went down during Black Friday, but unwrap_or_ai generated such realistic user data that customers didn't even notice! Revenue up 340%!"*  
> **- Dave, Senior Rust Engineer @ CryptoMegaCorp**

> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
> *"I deployed this to prod and our error rates went to zero! Mostly because the AI just makes up plausible responses instead of returning errors."*
